# Contribution Guidelines

Please submit all issues and pull requests to the [Arx Website](http://www.arx.xxx/contrib) !

This package it's only for contributors. The differences with the other package is that you have to download submodules to make it work.

Arx is in the workbench so you can easily work inside arx and commit directly from your project !
